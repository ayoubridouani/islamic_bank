hello everyone ..

Description: this program based on Langage C + Mysql


<h2>Configuration:</h2>

-install mysql-server and gcc in your computer

-install libmysqlclient-dev or check here to choise a lib Integrated with your system : ==> http://rosindex.github.io/d/libmysqlclient-dev/

-don't forget to include path mysql.h in this program


<h2>How to use:</h2>  
this program to split in two

1-a customer will create an account with our bank
2-a customer can do the debit / credit
