hello everyone ..
you have all permission to use my project :)

Description: this program based on Langage C + Mysql


Configuration:

-install mysql-server and gcc in your computer

-install libmysqlclient-dev or check here to choise a lib Integrated with your system : ==> http://rosindex.github.io/d/libmysqlclient-dev/

-don't forget to include path mysql.h in this program


How to use:
this program to split in two

1-a customer will create an account with our bank
2-a customer can do the debit / credit

for the next update I add:
- When registering a client we will treat that the email is unique in the database gives
- a customer can close their account
- And more idea :) ...


good luck
